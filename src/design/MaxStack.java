    We can solve Min Stack in a similar way IF min stack requires PopMin()

    Since this is a Premimum qn, please find the Description below :

    Description :
    Design a max stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax and popMax.

    push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
    pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
    top() -- Get the element on the top.
    peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
    popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.

    Note:
    1) -1e7 <= x <= 1e7
    2) Number of operations won't exceed 10000.
    3) The last four operations won't be called when stack is empty.
