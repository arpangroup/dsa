# Design Parking Lot üöó
A parking lot management system is designed to handle the operations of parking vehicles, collecting payments, and managing available space efficiently. The system should be able to accommodate different types of vehicles, provide payment options, and ensure a smooth user experience.
- https://codewitharyan.com/tech-blogs/design-snake-food-game

## Rules of the System  :

1. **Setup**:
   - The parking lot has multiple slots available for parking.
   - Different types of vehicles (bike, car, truck) can occupy different slot sizes.
   - Each vehicle is issued a parking ticket upon entry.
   - The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of stay and vehicle type.
3. **Exit and Payment:**:
   - A vehicle needs to make a payment before exiting. 
   - Multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI) should be supported. 
   - Once payment is successful, the vehicle is allowed to exit, and the parking slot is freed.
3. **Illegal Actions**:
   - A vehicle cannot park in an already occupied slot.
   - Vehicles cannot vacate without completing the payment process.

# 1. Interview Setting ü§ù
### Point 1 : Introduction and Vague Problem Statement

**üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer**: Let's start with a basic problem statement. Design a Parking Lot system.

**üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate**: Certainly! Here‚Äôs my understanding of the Parking Lot system:
- The system will manage different types of vehicles.
- Vehicles will enter and exit after making a payment.
- A parking slot is assigned upon entry and freed upon exit.
- Payment must be completed before leaving.
- The system should handle different vehicle sizes and slot allocations efficiently.

Is this the expected flow?

**üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer**:  Yes, you're aligned with the requirements. Please continue.


**üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate**: Great! Before diving into the design, I‚Äôd like to clarify a few requirements:
- Will we have multiple types of parking slots based on vehicle size?
- Are we supporting multiple payment methods?
- Should the system track the duration of each parked vehicle?
- Can there be multiple floors parking lots ?

### Point 2 : Clarifying requirements

üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer: We want a system that:
- Supports different vehicle types (Bike, Car, Truck).
- Has different slot sizes based on vehicle type.
- Allows multiple payment methods.
- Ensures smooth entry and exit with parking fee calculation.

üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate: To summarize, the key requirements are:
- A parking lot with multiple slot types.
- Support for bikes, cars, and trucks.
- Dynamic slot allocation based on vehicle size.
- Payment processing with multiple methods.
- Entry ticket issuance and exit validation.

üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer: Perfect, Let's Proceed.

### Point 3 : Identifying Key Components :
üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate: Now that we have the requirements, let‚Äôs identify the key components of our Parking Lot system:

1. Vehicle: Represents different types of vehicles.
   - Class: Vehicle
   - Description:  This class represents vehicles entering the parking lot.

````java
public abstract class Vehicle {
   protected String licensePlate;
   protected VehicleType type;
}
````

2. Parking Lot: MManages parking slots and vehicle allocations. <br/>
Class: ParkingLot <br/>
Description: This class manages the allocation and release of parking slots.
````java
public class ParkingLot {
     private List<ParkingSlot> slots; 
}
````

3. Parking Slot: Represents an individual parking space.
Class: ParkingSlot <br/>
Description: A slot has a type (Bike, Car, Truck) and an availability status.
````java
public class ParkingSlot {
     private VehicleType slotType;
     private boolean isOccupied; 
}
````

4. Payment System: Handles different payment methods like Credit Card, Cash, UPI etc
Class: Payment <br/>
Description: This class processes payments before exit.
````java
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    boolean processPayment(double amount);
}
````

Interviewer: That sounds good. Let‚Äôs proceed with the design details.

### Point 4 : Design Challenges:
**üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer**: What design challenges do you anticipate?

**üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate**: The key challenges for the Parking Lot system include:
   1. Efficient Slot Allocation: Ensuring vehicles are assigned to the correct slot type.
   2. Tracking Vehicle Duration: Keeping a record of entry times for payment calculations.
   3. Handling Payments: Supporting multiple payment methods dynamically.
   4. Managing Concurrency: Ensuring simultaneous vehicle entries and exits are handled properly.

### Point 5: Approach:
**üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer**:How would you approach these challenges?

**üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate**: I propose using design patterns effectively. Here are my strategies:

1. Factory for Vehicle Creation :
   - Allows easy extension for new vehicle types.
   - Ensures consistent object creation.
2. Strategy Pattern for Payments and Parking Fares :
   - Enables flexible payment methods and Parking fares based on the vehicle type and duration for the parking.
   - Easily extendable for future payment integrations and new fare strategy additions.
3. Singleton Pattern for Parking Lot Management :
   - Ensures only one instance of the parking lot exists.
4. Observer Pattern for Exit Notifications :
   - Notifies the system when a vehicle exits.
   - Can be extended for alerts or logging.
   

### Point 6 : Implementation
**üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer**: Ready to discuss implementation?

**üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate**:  Yes. I'll focus on a modular and scalable design that meets the core Parking Lot requirements.

# 2. Parking Lot Implementation with Design Patterns


## 2.1. Strategy Pattern for Parking Fare :
1. ParkingFeeStrategy Interface : <br/>
   Defines a common interface for different parking fee calculation strategies.

````java
// Interface for Parking Fee Calculation Strategy
public interface ParkingFeeStrategy {
   /**
    - Calculate parking fee based on vehicle type and duration
    - 
    - @param vehicleType Type of vehicle being parked
    - @param duration Duration of parking (in hours or days)
    - @param durationType Type of duration (HOURS or DAYS)
    - @return Calculated parking fee
    */
   double calculateFee(String vehicleType, int duration, DurationType durationType);
}
````

2. DurationType Enum : <br/>
Specifies the type of duration for parking (HOURS or DAYS).
````java
public enum DurationType { // Enum to specify duration type
   HOURS,
   DAYS
}
````

3. Define Concrete Strategies :
- BasicHourlyRateStrategy Class : <br/>
Concrete strategy for basic hourly rates. Rates vary based on vehicle type.
````java
// Concrete Strategy for Basic Hourly Rates
public class BasicHourlyRateStrategy implements ParkingFeeStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(String vehicleType, int duration, DurationType durationType) {
        // Different rates for different vehicle types
        switch (vehicleType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "car":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 10.0   // $10 per hour for cars
                    : duration * 10.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            case "bike":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 5.0    // $5 per hour for bikes
                    : duration * 5.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            case "auto":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 8.0    // $8 per hour for autos
                    : duration * 8.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            default:
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 15.0   // $15 per hour for other vehicles
                    : duration * 15.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
        }
    }
}
````

- PremiumRateStrategy Class : <br/>
Concrete strategy for premium rates. Premium rates have higher multipliers.

````java
// Concrete Strategy for Premium Rates
public class PremiumRateStrategy implements ParkingFeeStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(String vehicleType, int duration, DurationType durationType) {
        // Premium rates with higher multipliers
        switch (vehicleType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "car":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 15.0   // $15 per hour for cars
                    : duration * 15.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            case "bike":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 8.0    // $8 per hour for bikes
                    : duration * 8.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            case "auto":
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 12.0   // $12 per hour for autos
                    : duration * 12.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
            
            default:
                return durationType == DurationType.HOURS 
                    ? duration * 20.0   // $20 per hour for other vehicles
                    : duration * 20.0 * 24;  // Daily rate
        }
    }
}
````

## 2.2.  Factory Pattern for Vehicle Creation:
(FYI - Not necessarily a CORE PART OF THE PROBLEM !!)

To efficiently manage families of related objects such as cars, bikes, and scooters, we will utilize the Factory pattern for Vehicle Creation. First, let's define the Factory interfaces and their corresponding concrete factories.


Vehicle.java: Common Abstract Class for vehicles :

````java
// Abstract class representing a vehicle
public abstract class Vehicle {  
    private String licensePlate; // Stores the vehicle's license plate number
    private String vehicleType; // Stores the type of vehicle (e.g., car, bike, truck)
    private ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy; // Strategy for calculating parking fees
    // Constructor to initialize a vehicle with its license plate, type, and fee strategy
    public Vehicle(String licensePlate, String vehicleType, ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy) {  
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;  
        this.vehicleType = vehicleType;  
        this.feeStrategy = feeStrategy;  
    }  
    // Getter method to retrieve the vehicle type
    public String getVehicleType() {  
        return vehicleType;  
    }  
    // Getter method to retrieve the vehicle's license plate number
    public String getLicensePlate() {  
        return licensePlate;  
    }  
    // Method to calculate parking fee based on duration and duration type
    public double calculateFee(int duration, DurationType durationType) {  
        return feeStrategy.calculateFee(vehicleType, duration, durationType);
    }  
}
````

- Concrete Classes For Vehicle Types :

CarVehicle.java :
````java
public class CarVehicle extends Vehicle { 
    public CarVehicle(String licensePlate, ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy) { 
        super(licensePlate, "Car", feeStrategy); 
    } 
}
````

BikeVehicle.java :
````java
public class BikeVehicle extends Vehicle { 
    public BikeVehicle(String licensePlate, ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy) { 
        super(licensePlate, "Bike", feeStrategy); 
    } 
}
````

OtherVehicles.java :
````java
// OtherVehicle class for any other vehicle type
public class OtherVehicle extends Vehicle { 
    public OtherVehicle(String licensePlate, ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy) { 
        super(licensePlate, "Bike", feeStrategy); 
    } 
}
````

VehicleFactory.java Class :
````java
// Modify Vehicle Factory to support fee strategy
public class VehicleFactory {
  public static Vehicle createVehicle(
      String vehicleType, String licensePlate, ParkingFeeStrategy feeStrategy) {
    if (vehicleType.equalsIgnoreCase("Car")) {
      return new CarVehicle(licensePlate, feeStrategy);
    } else if (vehicleType.equalsIgnoreCase("Bike")) {
      return new BikeVehicle(licensePlate, feeStrategy);
    }
    return new OtherVehicle(
        licensePlate, feeStrategy); // For unsupported vehicle types
  }
}
````

## 2.3. Strategy Pattern for Payments :
To efficiently manage parking payments for different Vehicles, we will utilize the Strategy pattern for Vehicle Payments. let's define the Strategy interfaces and their corresponding concrete strategies.

PaymentStrategy.java, Common Interface for Different Payment Strategies :

````java
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}
````

‚Ä¢ Concrete Payment Strategies :

CashPayment.java :
````java
public class CashPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing cash payment of $" + amount);
        // Logic for cash payment processing
    }
}
````

CreditCardPayment.java :
````java
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
        // Logic for credit card payment processing
    }
}
````

Payment.java Client class for handling Payments :

````java
public class Payment {
    private double amount;
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy; // Payment strategy interface
    // Constructor to initialize the payment amount and payment strategy
    public Payment(double amount, PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }
    // Process the payment using the assigned strategy
    public void processPayment() {
        if (amount > 0) {
            paymentStrategy.processPayment(amount);  // Delegating to strategy
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid payment amount.");
        }
    }
}
````

## Parking Lot Logic and Implementation :
- In a parking lot, we can have multiple parking spots for different types of vehicles, such as cars, bikes, autos, scooters, etc. To efficiently manage these spots, we will start by defining a common abstract class for parking spots and then create concrete implementations for each type of vehicle.

- Here's how we can approach this: <br/>
Abstract Parking Spot Class: This class will serve as the base class for all types of parking spots and will define the common properties and methods shared by all spots.

````java
public abstract class ParkingSpot {
  private int spotNumber;
  private boolean isOccupied;
  private Vehicle vehicle;
  private String spotType;
  // Constructor to initialize parking spot with spot number and type
  public ParkingSpot(int spotNumber, String spotType) {
    this.spotNumber = spotNumber;
    this.isOccupied = false;
    this.spotType = spotType;
  }
  // Method to check if the spot is occupied
  public boolean isOccupied() {
    return isOccupied;
  }
  // Abstract method to check if a vehicle can park in this spot
  public abstract boolean canParkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle);
  // Method to park a vehicle in the spot
  public void parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    // Check if the spot is already occupied
    if (isOccupied) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Spot is already occupied.");
    }
    // Check if the vehicle can be parked in this spot
    if (!canParkVehicle(vehicle)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(
          "This spot is not suitable for" + vehicle.getVehicleType());
    }
    this.vehicle = vehicle;
    this.isOccupied = true;
  }
  // Method to vacate the parking spot
  public void vacate() {
    // Check if the spot is already vacant
    if (!isOccupied) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Spot is already vacant.");
    }
    this.vehicle = null;
    this.isOccupied = false;
  }
  // Getter for spot number
  public int getSpotNumber() {
    return spotNumber;
  }
  // Getter for the vehicle parked in the spot
  public Vehicle getVehicle() {
    return vehicle;
  }
  // Getter for spot type
  public String getSpotType() {
    return spotType;
  }
}
````

Concrete Parking Spot Classes: These classes will extend the abstract class and will represent specific types of parking spots for different vehicles (e.g., car, bike, scooter).

CarParkingSpot.java :
````java
public class CarParkingSpot extends ParkingSpot {
  public CarParkingSpot(int spotNumber) {
    super(spotNumber, "Car");
  }
  @Override
  public boolean canParkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    return "Car".equalsIgnoreCase(vehicle.getVehicleType());
  }
}
````

BikeParkingSpot.java :
````java
public class BikeParkingSpot extends ParkingSpot {
  public BikeParkingSpot(int spotNumber) {
    super(spotNumber, "Bike");
  }
  @Override
  public boolean canParkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    return "Bike".equalsIgnoreCase(vehicle.getVehicleType());
  }
}
````
Having defined our parking spots, let's proceed with implementing the ParkingLot class, which will handle the logic for managing parking spots and vehicles.


ParkingLot.java :
````java
public class ParkingLot {
  private List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots;
  // Constructor to initialize the parking lot with parking spots
  public ParkingLot(List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots) {
    this.parkingSpots = parkingSpots;
  }
  // Method to find an available spot based on vehicle type
  public ParkingSpot findAvailableSpot(String vehicleType) {
    for (ParkingSpot spot : parkingSpots) {
      if (!spot.isOccupied() && spot.getSpotType().equals(vehicleType)) {
        return spot; // Found an available spot for the vehicle type
      }
    }
    return null; // No available spot found for the given vehicle type
  }
  // Method to park a vehicle
  public ParkingSpot parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    ParkingSpot spot = findAvailableSpot(vehicle.getVehicleType());
    if (spot != null) {
      spot.parkVehicle(vehicle); // Mark the spot as occupied
      System.out.println(
          "Vehicle parked successfully in spot: " + spot.getSpotNumber());
      return spot;
    }
    System.out.println(
        "No parking spots available for " + vehicle.getVehicleType() + "!");
    return null;
  }
  // Method to vacate a parking spot
  public void vacateSpot(ParkingSpot spot, Vehicle vehicle) {
    if (spot != null && spot.isOccupied()
        && spot.getVehicle().equals(vehicle)) {
      spot.vacate(); // Free the spot
      System.out.println(vehicle.getVehicleType()
          + " vacated the spot: " + spot.getSpotNumber());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Invalid operation! Either the spot is already vacant "
                         + "or the vehicle does not match.");
    }
  }
  // Method to find a spot by its number
  public ParkingSpot getSpotByNumber(int spotNumber) {
    for (ParkingSpot spot : parkingSpots) {
      if (spot.getSpotNumber() == spotNumber) {
        return spot;
      }
    }
    return null; // Spot not found
  }
  // Getter for parking spots
  public List<ParkingSpot> getParkingSpots() {
    return parkingSpots;
  }
}
````


Main Method to Run the Parking Lot :

````java
public class ParkingLotMain {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Initialize parking spots
    List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots = new ArrayList<>();
    parkingSpots.add(new CarParkingSpot(1));
    parkingSpots.add(new CarParkingSpot(2));
    parkingSpots.add(new BikeParkingSpot(3));
    parkingSpots.add(new BikeParkingSpot(4));
    // Initialize parking lot
    ParkingLot parkingLot = new ParkingLot(parkingSpots);
    // Create fee strategies
    ParkingFeeStrategy basicHourlyRateStrategy = new BasicHourlyRateStrategy();
    ParkingFeeStrategy premiumRateStrategy = new PremiumRateStrategy();
    // Create vehicles using Factory Pattern with fee strategies
    Vehicle car1 =
        VehicleFactory.createVehicle("Car", "CAR123", basicHourlyRateStrategy);
    Vehicle bike1 =
        VehicleFactory.createVehicle("Bike", "BIKE456", premiumRateStrategy);
    // Park vehicles
    ParkingSpot carSpot = parkingLot.parkVehicle(car1);
    ParkingSpot bikeSpot = parkingLot.parkVehicle(bike1);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Select payment method for your vehicle:");
    System.out.println("1. Credit Card");
    System.out.println("2. Cash");
    int paymentMethod = scanner.nextInt();
    // Process payments using Strategy Patterns
    if (carSpot != null) {
      // Calculate fee using the specific strategy for the vehicle
      double carFee = car1.calculateFee(2, DurationType.HOURS);
      PaymentStrategy carPaymentStrategy =
          getPaymentStrategy(paymentMethod, carFee);
      carPaymentStrategy.processPayment(carFee);
      parkingLot.vacateSpot(carSpot, car1);
    }
    if (bikeSpot != null) {
      // Calculate fee using the specific strategy for the vehicle
      double bikeFee = bike1.calculateFee(3, DurationType.HOURS);
      PaymentStrategy bikePaymentStrategy =
          getPaymentStrategy(paymentMethod, bikeFee);
      bikePaymentStrategy.processPayment(bikeFee);
      parkingLot.vacateSpot(bikeSpot, bike1);
    }
    scanner.close();
  }
  private static PaymentStrategy getPaymentStrategy(
      int paymentMethod, double fee) {
    switch (paymentMethod) {
      case 1:
        return new CreditCardPayment(fee);
      case 2:
        return new CashPayment(fee);
      default:
        System.out.println("Invalid choice! Default to Credit card payment.");
        return new CreditCardPayment(fee);
    }
  }
}
````


üßë‚ÄçüíºInterviewer: Looks good. What makes your approach effective?

üßë‚ÄçüíªCandidate: Here are the key strengths of my approach:
   - **Scalability**: The design allows easy expansion to accommodate more vehicle types, parking spot categories, and payment methods.
   - **Modularity**: Each component, such as vehicle creation, parking management, and payment processing, is handled separately, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.
   - **Flexibility**: The use of design patterns like Factory and Strategy allows seamless modifications and enhancements without affecting existing code.
   - **Clarity**: The architecture is intuitive, making it easy for developers to understand, implement, and extend when needed.
   - **Extensibility**:  


---


## 5. Extensibility: Implementing Multi-Floor Parking Lot
Currently, our Parking Lot implementation is based on a single floor. However, if an interviewer asks how you would extend your solution to accommodate a multi-floor Parking Lot.

Here‚Äôs how you should respond:

To extend the solution for a multi-floor Parking Lot, we can create a concrete ParkingFloor class and encapsulate the logic of handling parking spots within this class. The ParkingLot class would then be responsible for managing multiple parking floors, while each floor would handle its own parking spots. This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring that each class has a clear and distinct responsibility.

1. Concrete Parking Floor class :

ParkingFloor.java :
````java
public class ParkingFloor {
  // List of parking spots on this floor
  private List<ParkingSpot> spots;
  // Unique identifier for the floor
  private int floorNumber;
  public ParkingFloor(int floorNumber) {
    this.floorNumber = floorNumber;
    this.spots = new ArrayList<>();
  }
  // Adds a parking spot to this floor.
  public void addParkingSpot(ParkingSpot spot) {
    this.spots.add(spot);
  }
  // Finds an available parking spot for a specific vehicle type.
  public ParkingSpot findAvailableSpot(String vehicleType) {
    // Iterate through all spots to find an available spot matching the vehicle
    // type
    for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
      // Check if the spot is not occupied and matches the vehicle type
      if (!spot.isOccupied()
          && spot.getSpotType().equalsIgnoreCase(vehicleType)) {
        return spot;
      }
    }
    return null; // No available spot found
  }
  // Retrieves all parking spots on this floor.
  public List<ParkingSpot> getParkingSpots() {
    return spots;
  }
  public int getFloorNumber() {
    return floorNumber;
  }
}
````


2. Create a New Builder Class for Parking Lot :
````java
/**
 - Builder class for creating a flexible and extensible parking lot.
 - Provides a fluent interface for constructing multi-floor parking lots.
 */
public class ParkingLotBuilder {
  // List of floors to be added to the parking lot
  private List<ParkingFloor> floors;
  // Constructor initializes the list of floors.
  public ParkingLotBuilder() {
    this.floors = new ArrayList<>();
  }
  // Adds a pre-configured parking floor to the parking lot.
  public ParkingLotBuilder addFloor(ParkingFloor floor) {
    floors.add(floor);
    return this;
  }
  // Creates a floor with specified numbers of different vehicle parking spots.
  public ParkingLotBuilder createFloor(int floorNumber, int numOfCarSpots,
      int numOfBikeSpots, int... otherSpotCounts) {
    // Create a new parking floor
    ParkingFloor floor = new ParkingFloor(floorNumber);
    // Add car spots
    for (int i = 0; i < numOfCarSpots; i++) {
      floor.addParkingSpot(new CarParkingSpot(i + 1));
    }
    // Add bike spots
    for (int i = 0; i < numOfBikeSpots; i++) {
      floor.addParkingSpot(new BikeParkingSpot(numOfCarSpots + i + 1));
    }
    // Add other types of spots if provided
    int spotOffset = numOfCarSpots + numOfBikeSpots;
    for (int i = 0; i < otherSpotCounts.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < otherSpotCounts[i]; j++) {
        // Dynamically add other vehicle type spots
        // Note: This uses OtherVehicle as a placeholder. In a real system,
        // you might want a more robust way to handle different vehicle types
        floor.addParkingSpot(new OtherVehicle(
            spotOffset + j + 1, new BasicHourlyRateStrategy()));
      }
      // Update the spot offset for the next type of vehicle
      spotOffset += otherSpotCounts[i];
    }
    // Add the configured floor to the list of floors
    floors.add(floor);
    return this;
  }
  // Builds and returns the fully configured parking lot.
  public ParkingLot build() {
    return new ParkingLot(floors);
  }
}

3. Modify The parkingLot class to Accommodate the Multiple Floors logic :
````java
import java.util.List;

// Class representing a parking lot with multiple floors
public class ParkingLot {
  private List<ParkingFloor>
      floors; // List of parking floors in the parking lot
  // Constructor to initialize the parking lot with given floors
  public ParkingLot(List<ParkingFloor> floors) {
    this.floors = floors;
  }
  // Method to find the first available parking spot for a given vehicle type
  public ParkingSpot findAvailableSpot(String vehicleType) {
    for (ParkingFloor floor : floors) {
      ParkingSpot spot = floor.findAvailableSpot(vehicleType);
      if (spot != null) {
        return spot; // Return the first available spot found
      }
    }
    return null; // Return null if no spot is available
  }
  // Method to park a vehicle in an available spot
  public ParkingSpot parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    ParkingSpot spot = findAvailableSpot(vehicle.getVehicleType());
    if (spot != null) {
      spot.parkVehicle(vehicle); // Park the vehicle in the found spot
      System.out.println(
          "Vehicle parked successfully in spot: " + spot.getSpotNumber());
      return spot;
    }
    // If no spot is available, notify the user
    System.out.println(
        "No parking spots available for " + vehicle.getVehicleType() + "!");
    return null;
  }
  // Method to vacate a parking spot
  public void vacateSpot(ParkingSpot spot, Vehicle vehicle) {
    // Ensure the spot is occupied and the vehicle matches before vacating
    if (spot != null && spot.isOccupied()
        && spot.getVehicle().equals(vehicle)) {
      spot.vacate(); // Free up the parking spot
      System.out.println(vehicle.getVehicleType()
          + " vacated the spot: " + spot.getSpotNumber());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Invalid operation! Either the spot is already vacant "
                         + "or the vehicle does not match.");
    }
  }
  // Method to retrieve a parking spot by its spot number
  public ParkingSpot getSpotByNumber(int spotNumber) {
    for (ParkingFloor floor : floors) {
      for (ParkingSpot spot : floor.getParkingSpots()) {
        if (spot.getSpotNumber() == spotNumber) {
          return spot; // Return the parking spot if found
        }
      }
    }
    return null; // Return null if no spot with the given number exists
  }
  // Getter method to retrieve the list of parking floors
  public List<ParkingFloor> getFloors() {
    return floors;
  }
}
````


4. Modify the parking lot Main class to Accommodate the Multiple floors logic :
````java
// Demonstrates the usage of the flexible parking lot builder.
public class ParkingLotMain {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a parking lot with multiple floors and varied spot configurations
    ParkingLot parkingLot =
        new ParkingLotBuilder()
            // First floor: 2 car spots, 2 bike spots
            .createFloor(1, 2, 2)
            // Second floor: 3 car spots, 1 bike spot, 1 other vehicle spot
            .createFloor(2, 3, 1, 1)
            .build();
    // Existing parking lot logic can be applied as before
    // Example: parking vehicles, calculating fees, etc.
  }
}
````
